# This is main rc file. It is setp up to read the set of rules from
# the following files ("defaults/npemwinfilter.rc" is not installed)
#
# site/npemwinfilter.rc
# rc.d/npemwin/*.rc
#
# The rules should be put in any of those files. See the file SCRIPTING
# for some instructions and the npemwinfilter.rc-ex for examples. 

#
# Each rc file contains a set of conditions and a correspondig
# set of actions, ech of which is put in a list. Then all such
# sets are put in a list of lists, stored in
# the <prefix>filter(cond) and <prefix>filter(action) variables.
#
# The rc_status variable is set to 0 when a rule is matched.

# Load all the sets of condition/action pairs.
