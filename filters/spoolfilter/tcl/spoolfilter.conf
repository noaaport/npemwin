# NOTES:
#
# -
# If the "uwildregex" is empty, then nothing is accepted. Otherwise it
# should be comma-separated list of patterns, each of which maybe preceeded
# by a negation (!) sign. The ppath is checked against each pattern,
# left to right. If no pattern matches, the product is rejected. Otherwise,
# when a match is found a status variable is set to 1, or 0 if the pattern
# is negated. After the process finishes, a product is accepted if the status
# variable is 1. (The ppath is the root name of of the basename of
# the file: e.g., <wfo>/<fbasename>).
#
# For example, to accept only a few products, use
#
#    set spoolfilter(uwildregex) {^(tjsj|knhc)}
#
# To accept everything except a few products,
#
#     set spoolfilter(uwildregex) {.*,!^kwal}
#
# Same thing but accepting a few products from kwal
#
#     set spoolfilter(uwildregex) {.*,!^kwal,kwal/xxxxxx}
#
# -
# If the variable $spoolfilter(filessubdir) is empty (i.e. ""), then the
# files are saved in the directory  "files/<station>/<basename>. Otherwise
# the string is taken as a format to the tcl "clock format" command to make
# a subdirectory name under "files"; e.g. "files/<subdir>/<station>/<basename>.
# The "%u" setting above returns the week day, so that the files are saved
# in a directory tree
#	files/1/<station>/fbasename
#	files/2/<station>/fbasename
#
# with each directory "files/<n>" holding one day worth of files.
#
# A seting such as
#
#	set spoolfilter(filessubdir) "%Y%m%d";
#
# would give directory names like
#
#	files/20080523/<station>
#
# which is the default.
