NOTE - 01 Nov 2024

This script is deprecated, kept here only for reference.

The problem: the qrunner sends the files to the filters _after_
striping the ending \r\r\n that the native files (the same as
the noaaport-sbn files). Thus nbsp is not able to determine
correctly the awips headers because uses the \r\r\n sequence as a guide.
The solution: the qrunner itself calls nbspmcast, using the original
native files as the source.

The notes below are from the original README

===========================================================================
install -m 0755 nbspfilter.tcl /usr/local/libexec/npemwin/site/nbspfilter
install -m 0644 filters.conf-site /usr/local/etc/npemwin/site/filters.conf

# optional
install -m 0644 nbspfilter.conf /usr/local/etc/npemwin

The original version of this script used to call nbspinsert. In that case
we used to have the following note:

[ NOTE:
  The nbspfilter script requires tclx which is not installed
  by default.
]

The current version uses nbspmcast, and therefore this version does
not need tclx.

The original version of this script is maintained with the "-orig"
suffix for reference.
