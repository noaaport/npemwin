# Using M/2 will miss (and give errors) when the files that are replaced
# in the server when we they are being downloaded. The alternative is
# to run every minute (M); that would work well at the odd minutes and
# give error at the even minutes (either read errors or duplicate downloads)
# which we can ignore.
