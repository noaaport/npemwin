I was getting the error

PM build errors:
    Empty %files file /home/nieves/rpmbuild/BUILD/npemwin-3.0.1p1/debugsourcefiles.list

For some reason this is happening in alma linux 8 (and there are posts
indicating centos-8 as well).  For the moment I am using this setting
in rpm-spec.in as a temporary workaround:

%global debug_package %{nil}
