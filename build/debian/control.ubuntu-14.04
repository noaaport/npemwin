Description: Emwin server
 Npemwin will connect to a list of EMWIN servers and save all
 files into a directory based on file type and WFO ID. Extensive
 facilities allow to call a script for each complete file received
 for post-processing (alarms/notifications, database insertion, and more).
 It can in turn serve any number of byte blaster clients
 (including other instances of npemwin itself).
 Alternatively, it can connect to a NOAAPort nbsp server and get the data
 that way. It can also be configured to injest from a directly
 attached serial device.
