To start the npemwind daemon automatically out of the local rc.d directory,
set the variable

npemwind_enable=1

in /etc/rc.conf.local.

The configuration files are installed in

	/usr/local/etc/npemwin.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/npemwin, and already enabled the servers.conf file.
The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

Some common configuration options are indicated in various
sample configuration files in the /usr/local/etc/npemwin
directories and the defaults subdirectory.

The directory /usr/local/share/doc/npemwin contains
instructions for installing filters to process the files as they are
received.

The installation process should have created various directories
under /var/noaaport, and already enabled the rstfilter and dafilter.
In addition the web server is enabled by default, and can be
accesed as
	
	http://localhost:8016
or
	http://<hostname>:8016

The program will run in this default installation without further
configuration.

As of version 2.0.r2, npemwind runs as user noaaport, and therefore
the directories where the daemon writes must be owned by that user:

    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/npemwin
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/log/npemwin
    chown -R noaaport:noaaport /var/run/npemwin

During a fresh install, the package installer will create the
directories with the appropriate ownership, but not during an upgrade.
If you are uprading from an older version, those commands must be
executed manually.
