Npemwin will connect to a list of EMWIN servers and save all
files into a directory based on file type and WFO ID. Extensive
facilities allow to call a script for each complete file received
for post-processing (alarms/notifications, database insertion, and more).
It can in turn serve any number of byte blaster clients
(including other instances of npemwin itself).

Alternatively, it can connect to a NOAAPort nbsp server and get the data
that way.

It can also be configured to injest from a directly attached serial device.
