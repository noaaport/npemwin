  Npemwin will connect to a list of EMWIN servers and save all
  files into a directory based on file type and WFO ID. Extensive
  facilities allow to call a script for each complete file received
  for post-processing (alarms/notifications, database insertion, and more).
  It can in turn serve any number of byte blaster clients
  (including other instances of npemwin itself).

  Alternatively, it can connect to a NOAAPort nbsp server and get the data
  that way.

  It can also be configured to injest from a directly attached serial device.
