  This note is borrowed from the nbsp src -
  
  June 2022 - Added this note (for debian 11) because gcc was complaining
  about multiple defintions of "g".

  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69908418/ \
  multiple-definition-of-first-defined-here-on-gcc-10-2-1-but-not-gcc-8-3-0]

  In C a definition of a global variable that does not initialise the variable
  is considered "tentative". You can have multiple tentative definitions of a
  variable in the same compilation unit. Multiple tentative defintions in
  different compilation units are not allowed in standard C, but were
  historically allowed by C compilers on unix systems.

  Older versions of gcc would allow multiple tenative definitions (but not
  multiple non-tentative definitions) of a global variable in different
  compilation units by default. gcc-10 does not. You can restore the old
  behavior with the command line option "-fcommon" but this is discouraged.
