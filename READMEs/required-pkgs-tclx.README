In contrast to nbsp, npemwin does not need additional packages
beyond what is specified in the buid directories (e.g., freebsd, rpm, debian).
In particular tclx is not required.

[When the nbspfilter was used (it was not installed by default),
then the tclx package had to be installed because nbsfilter used it.
In the current version, the tool used to interface with nbsp is
nbspmcast [a C program] and the tclx library is not needed.]
