In contrast to nbsp, npemwin does not need additional packages
beyond what is specified in the buid directories (bsdng, rpm, debian).
In particular tclx is not required.

However, if the nbspfilter is used (it is not installed by default),
then the tclx package must be installed because nbsfilter uses it.
