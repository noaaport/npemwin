# Configuration file for the qrunner script. The commented values

# defaults/qrunner.conf
# site/qrunner.conf
#
# The recomended way to override these settings is to put them in the "site"
# file.

# Directory where all raw data files, q files, etc, are stored.
#
### spooldir=/var/npemwin/spool

# Subdirectory where the daemon write the block files as they are received
#
### datadir=data

# Subdirectory where it keeps the q files
#
### qdir=qfiles

# Subdirectory where it keeps the lock file (to prevent two instances
# of the script from running), and the file name.
#
### lockdir=lock
### lockfilename=qrunner.lock
 
# Where the qrunner saves the processed files.
# NOTE: This setting must be in sync with the corresponding setting in
#       the tclhttpd configuration file.
#
### out_dirname=/var/npemwin/files

# The qrunner purges unprocessed files from the data directories
# if they are older than this.
#
### max_elapsed_time=60		# in minutes

# The program that the qrunner calls for each completely procesed file.
# Nothing is installed by default.
#
### userfilter_enable=0
### userfilter=/usr/local/libexec/npemwin_site/userfilter

# The program that the qrunner calls each time it is executed.
# npemwin comes with a standard set of filters which are executed
# using this facility. They can be disabled individually, or all
# of them can be disabled here by setting postfilter_enable=0.
#
### postfilter_enable=1
### postfilter=/usr/local/libexec/npemwin/postfilter
### postfilterqfname=postfilter.q

# When the postprocessing filters are enabled, if this variable is 1, then 
# the retransmissions will be detected and will not be sent to the filters.
# A soft link is created for every file received. This does not take a
# significant amount of space, but it does require twice as many ionodes
# in the file system. To send the retransmissions to the postprocessing
# filters, set the variable to 0.
#
### detect_duplicates=1

# Log a message for every file received 
#
### verbose=0

# The only external programs used are find and unzip, but to make sure.
#
### PATH="%PATH%"
### FIND=%FIND%
