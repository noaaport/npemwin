# The recomended way to override these settings is to put them in the "site"
# file.

# Directory where all raw data files, q files, etc, are stored.

### spooldir=/var/npemwin/spool

# Subdirectory where the daemon write the block files as they are received

### qdir=qfiles

# Subdirectory where it keeps the lock file (to prevent two instances
# of the script from running), and the file name.
#
### lockdir=lock
### lockfilename=qrunner.lock
 
# Where the qrunner saves the processed files.
# NOTE: This setting must be in sync with the corresponding setting in
#       the tclhttpd configuration file.

### out_dirname=/var/npemwin/files

# The qrunner purges unprocessed files from the data directories
# if they are older than this.

# The program that the qrunner calls for each completely procesed file.
# Nothing is installed by default.
#
### userfilter_enable=0
### userfilter=/usr/local/libexec/npemwin_site/userfilter

# The program that the qrunner calls each time it is executed.
# npemwin comes with a standard set of filters which are executed
# using this facility. They can be disabled individually, or all
# of them can be disabled here by setting postfilter_enable=0.
#
### postfilter_enable=1

# Whether to send the txt files (raw, as received) to nbsp.
# The files are sent as received, before the qrunner strips the \r,
# which is what nbsp expects. (Requires nbspmcast).
nbsp_enable=0

# When the postprocessing filters are enabled, if this variable is 1, then 
# the retransmissions will be detected and will not be sent to the filters.
# A soft link is created for every file received. This does not take a
# significant amount of space, but it does require twice as many ionodes
# in the file system. To send the retransmissions to the postprocessing
# filters, set the variable to 0.
#
### detect_duplicates=1

# Log a message for every file received
