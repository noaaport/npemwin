# This is the configuration file for the hourly script.
# It deletes files in the specified directories that are
# older than the specified time or based on a retention count.
#
# The lines are of one of the following two the forms:
#
# <timespec>:<dir>:<expression>
# <timespec>:<dir>:<exclude subdirs>:<expression>
#
# In the first form, `find' is applied to <dir>. In the second form, `find'
# is applied to the subdirectories of <dir>, excluding the subdirectories
# whose names match the regular expression <exclude subdirs>.
# <expression> is the time specification expression that is passed to find,
# or an option string of the form -c <count> [-e <excludelist>] indicating
# a retention count and optionally a regexp specifying file names to
# exclude from the deletion list.
# A retention count can be specified only if the files in the directory
# and its subdirectories are saved with a date-time based name so that
# they sort according to their age.
# If the "-d" is given, then the subdirectories of <dir> are treated as files
# instead of being processed recursively. This is useful, for example, when
# when <dir> has subdirectories with names like 20090223 20090224.
#
# The time specification is one of
#
# H		=> run every hour
# H=ll|mm|nn	=> run at the hours in the list
# H/n		=> run if the remainder of the (current hour)/n is zero. 
#
# D=ddhh|d'd'h'h'|...	=> run at the days of the month and hours in the list.
#			   Here the dd is between 01-31.
# Dhh|h'h'|.../n	=> run if the remainder of (current day of month)/n
#			   is zero and the current hour is in the list.
#			
# W=dhh|d'h'h'|...	=> run at the days of the week and hours in the list.
#			   Here the d is between 0-6 with 0 = sunday.
# Whh|h'h'|.../n	=> run if the remainder of (current day of week)/n
#			   is zero and the current hour is in the list.
#
# Examples
#
# H/3  => run at 0, 3, 6, ...
# H=03|09|18|23  => run at 03, 09, 18 and 23.
# W=523 => run on fridays at 11 pm
# D=0101 => run on the first of the month at 1 am.
# D03|21/2  => run every other day at 3 am and 9 pm.

# Delete _files_ in the data directories (older than two days)
# The data{latest,metar,track} directories do not have to be checked.
# Note that the "digatmos/hurricane" subdirectory is excluded.
# If the metar (weatherscope) archives are enabled, then the setting below
# allows seven days of daily and hourly archives.
