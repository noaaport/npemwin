The original "sample" configuration files are in the "dist" subdirectory,
as well as several README files.

The directory

	/usr/local/etc/npemwin

contains the main configuration file "npemwind.conf", and other configuration
files. After the program reads it, it looks for the files

	defaults/npemwind.conf
	site/npemwind.conf

and if they exist they will be read, in that order. Latter settings
override previous ones. Similar conventions are used in the
configuration files for the qrunner and the filters.

Every npemwin package is distributed with an identical set of configuration
files. The purpose of the "defaults" subdirectory is to be able to distribute
packages pre-configured for a particular purpose. The corresponding
configuration files are placed in that subdirectory.

The "site" subdirectory is always distributed empty, and this is
where the configuration files that contain the local modifications
should be placed. The files named

	*.conf-<something>-sample

contain some common options as examples. They
can be copied to the site directory, renamed, and edited to build
the local configuration if desired.

npemwin is configured by default to get the data from a list of byteblaster
servers. To configure it to advertise itself as as server, follow the
instructions in bbserver.README.

To configure npemwin to read from a serial port device instead,
follow the instructions in serial.README.

npemwin can be configured instead as a client of a Noaaport nbsp server.
The dist directory contains two *-noaaport-sample files that can be
copied to the site subdirectory and will enable this mode of operation.

After the emwin service was decomissioned, one option is to download
the files  using what we call the ``infeed''. To configure npemwin this way
follow the instructions in ``READMEs/emftp.README'', reproduced below.

Setting npemwin to fetch the files by ftp

After the emwin service was decomissioned, one option is to download
the files from the url mentioned above, using what we call the
``infeed''. To configure npemwin this way, copy the files

   dist/npemwind.conf-infeed-sample
   dist/servers.conf-infeed-sample
   dist/scheduler.conf-infeed-sample

   to the npemwin "site" configuration directory:

   site/npemwind.conf
   site/servers.conf
   site/scheduler.conf
