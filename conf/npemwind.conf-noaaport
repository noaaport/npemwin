# Configuration file for npemwind as a noaaport client. This file,
# when saved as "site/npemwind.conf", overrides some of the variables
# that are specified in the npemwind.conf file in the main directory.
# The file "site/servers.conf" specified below must exist also.
#
# NOTE: Noaaport and emwin are very different. Both the nbsp server
#       and this npemwin client behave correctly with ``any'' seetings here,
#       but they have been chosen with those differences in mind.
#       If you have any need to change them, we would like to know about it.
