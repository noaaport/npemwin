# Blank lines and lines that begin with a '#' character are ignored.
# The two columns can be separated by any number of spaces and/or tabs.
# The first column can contain an ip address or a hostname, and the
# second column is the port. If the ip starts with one ampersand ('@')
# or two ('@@') ampersands, then it is interpreted to be a WX14 device; e.g.,
#
### @wx14.fincher.net 7002
### @136.145.84.22    7002

# In the first case (one ampersand), it is asumed that it is using the
# wx14 message format port, while in the second one it is assumed to be
# the emwin raw data port.
#
# If the first column starts with the '/' character, it is interpreted
# as a serial device and the second column as the serial port configuration
# parameters: e.g.,
#
### /dev/cuau0	9600,n,8,1      (FreeBSD)
### /dev/ttyS0  9600,n,8,1      (Linux)
