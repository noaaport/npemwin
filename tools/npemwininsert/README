- Files

The auxiliary files

err.{c,h} - nbsp/filters/filterlib/c
file.{c,h}, util.{c,h} - nbsp/src

are trimmed down versions of the corresponding files in the
indicated nbsp directories.

The file

io.{c,h}

mimicks the correspondig file in "nbsp/filters/filterlib/c",
but adapted for the present case.

The files

emwin.{c,h}

are also borrowed from the corresponding ones in "nbsp/src",
adapted to use the npemwin fifo as output.

- Implementation

1) emftp downloads, unzip, and save renamed files in its spool
2) instead of calling nbspinsert, calls "npemwininsert":

   npemwininsert <emwinname> <fpath> (with same options as nbspinsert), and

     emwinname = xxxyyyzz.<ext> (.e.g, fwmilmnc.txt)


3) npemwinsert (a C program) - based on nbsp/emwin.{c,h} splits
   the file in emwin packets and writes them to the npemwin fifo.
