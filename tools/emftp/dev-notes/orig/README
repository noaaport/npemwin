This is the standalone version of emftp, as I started to implement it.
It can be (and was) used for testing, and served as the basis for
the version incorporated in npemwin.

What follows is the oroginal README in that version.

The simplest way to install is to put the following line
in /etc/local/nbsp/site/scheduler.conf:

schedule M/2 /var/noaaport/emftp/emftp.sh

or the following in /etc/local/npemwin/site/scheduler.conf:

lappend schedule {
  M/2:/var/npemwin/emftp.sh &
}

There are two alternatives for enabling nbsp processing 

1) Do not enable nbsp processing here, but enable npemwin processing, and 
   install the nbspfilter in npemwin.

2) Enable nbsp processing here, but do not install the nbspfilter in npemwin,
   or disable npemwin processing here.

NOTES:

1) This script calls "nbspinsert" (tcl). If other programs (e.g. ldm via the
craftfilter) also calls nbspinsert then the nbsp/spool directory
must have permissions 662 so this instance of nbspinsert can write files
to the station directories that the other nbspinsert instances (e.g. ldm)
may create.

2) If there are other programs that also use "nbspinsert" (as mentioned in [2])
then it is a good idea to configure "nbspinsert" to use locking. This is
accomplsihed by calling "nbspinsert -l" once, which will create the lock
file (by default "/var/run/nbsp/infeed.fifo.lock") that is subsequently
used by "nbspinsert" each time it is invoked.

3) This script calls npemwininsert (C) , and the same comments in (1) and (2)
above apply also. But as of this moment (10 aug 2022), locking is not yet
implemented in npemwinsert.
