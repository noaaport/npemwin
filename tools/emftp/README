The simplest way to install is to put the following line
in /etc/local/npemwin/site/scheduler.conf:

lappend schedule {
  M/2:/usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp &
}

or the following in /etc/local/nbsp/site/scheduler.conf:

schedule M/2 /usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp

There are two alternatives for enabling nbsp processing 

1) Do not enable nbsp processing here, but enable npemwin processing, and 
   install the nbspfilter in npemwin.

2) Enable nbsp processing here, but do not install the nbspfilter in npemwin,
   or disable npemwin processing here.

NOTES:

1) This script calls "nbspinsert". If other programs (e.g. ldm via the
craftfilter) also calls nbspinsert then the nbsp/spool directory
must have permissions 662 so this instance of nbspinsert can write files
to the station directories that the other nbspinsert instances (e.g. ldm)
may create.

2) This script calls npemwininsert (C program), and the same comments in (1)
apply.
