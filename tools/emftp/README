1) The simplest way to install is to put the following line
   in /etc/local/npemwin/site/scheduler.conf:

lappend schedule {
  M/2:/usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp &
}

or the following in /etc/local/nbsp/site/scheduler.conf:

schedule M/2 /usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp

NOTE: for txt it is safer to run every minute rather than every two (M/2):
lappend schedule {
  M:/usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp &
}

2) Nbsp processing is not enable by default. It can be enabled in
   the "emftp.conf" file.
