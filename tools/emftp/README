The simplest way to install is to put the following line
in /etc/local/nbsp/site/scheduler.conf:

schedule M/2 /usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp

or the following in /etc/local/npemwin/site/scheduler.conf:

lappend schedule {
  M/2:/usr/local/libexec/npemwin/emftp &
}

There are two alternatives for enabling nbsp processing 

1) Do not enable nbsp processing here, but enable npemwin processing, and 
   install the nbspfilter in npemwin.

2) Enable nbsp processing here, but do not install the nbspfilter in npemwin,
   or disable npemwin processing here.

NOTES:

1) This script calls "nbspinsert". If other programs (e.g. ldm via the
craftfilter) also calls nbspinsert then the nbsp/spool directory
must have permissions 662 so this instance of nbspinsert can write files
to the station directories that the other nbspinsert instances (e.g. ldm)
may create.

2) If there are other programs that also use "nbspinsert" (as mentioned in [1])
then it is a good idea to configure "nbspinsert" to use locking. This is
accomplisihed by manually executing  "nbspinsert -l" once, which will create
the lock file (by default "/var/run/nbsp/infeed.fifo.lock") that is subsequently
used by "nbspinsert" each time it is invoked.

3) This script calls npemwininsert (C program), and the same comments in (1)
and (2) above apply. But in contrast to nbspinsert (which is a tcl script
and in that case the tclx flock is implemented via fcntl which does
not work in fifos in freebsd), npemwininsert is a C program.
Therefore, we use locking on the fifo via flock() (which does work on freebsd).
In addition, emftp takes care of locking itself.
