One drawback of emftp is that the names of the files are sometimes
not transparent. One particularly anoying case has to do with
the hurricane files, like TCPAT, TCDAT, and so on.

For example emftp receives files that it saves in

/var/npemwin/emftp/spool/txt/knhc/

as (for reference the files are stored in ``filenames.tgz'')

hadt45us.20240812.204600.txt
hapt35us.20240812.235601.txt
tcvat5fl.20240812.204812.txt
tcvat5fl.20240812.235703.txt

The original names of these files are the long names explained
in emftp.sh, with the hadt45us taken from the last component
of those long names.

But the point we want to make here is that those names do not
reflect the contents. The first lines of the first two examples files are

hadt45us.20240812.204600.txt:

WTNT45 KNHC 122045
TCDAT5

Tropical Storm Ernesto Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
500 PM AST Mon Aug 12 2024

hapt35us.20240812.235601.txt:

WTNT35 KNHC 122355
TCPAT5

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ernesto Intermediate Advisory Number 5A
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052024
800 PM AST Mon Aug 12 2024

The end result is that looking at the names of the files saved
in the "latest" subdirectory (by the stdfilter, which does not modify these
names) in many cases do not indicate the awips of the file.
This contrasts with the names produced by the dafilter (for example)
which saves the files with the awips keyword in the name;
for example tcdat5.<seqnumber>, tcpat5.<seqnumber>,
(in this case in the nwx/hurricane subdirectory).
