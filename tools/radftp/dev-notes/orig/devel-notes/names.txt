The names in nbsp (as saved in digatmos/nexrad/nids) are of the form

n0qjua_20170222_1641.nids

This can be constructed from the sn.last that is downloaded,
or from the name as we save it (e.g. n0q.nids) as follows:

seconds=`nbspradinfo -t sn.last`
datetime=`date -d "@${seconds}" -u "+%Y%m%d_%H%M"`

mv sn.last n0qjua_${datetime}.nids
